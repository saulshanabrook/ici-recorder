# `ici.recorder`

For recording experiments at the [Institute for Computational Intelligence
at Hampshire College](http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/ici.html).

*This is currently a proof of concept. If it works out, then I will clean up code, add some tests, and extract reusable contents to another repo*
